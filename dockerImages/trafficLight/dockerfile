# Dockerfile for bensrubishcode/traffic_light
# Runs traffic_light_controller.py: Queries sensors (raw socket),
# evaluates trust (fuzzy logic using pre-calculated ML scores from map),
# queries central server (HTTP).
# This version does NOT include ML model loading or prediction.

# Use a lightweight Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
ENV MPLCONFIGDIR /tmp/matplotlib # To prevent matplotlib font cache issues

    # Added 'packaging' as it's a dependency for scikit-fuzzy
    # Added 'networkx' as it's a dependency for skfuzzy.control
    # pandas and scikit-learn are NOT needed here anymore as ML prediction is done by automation.py

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the controller script into the container
# This script will read static features AND pre-calculated ML scores from the map file.
COPY traffic_light_controller.py .
# NO NEED to copy ml_risk_assessor.py or .joblib model files here anymore.

# Command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "traffic_light_controller.py"]
